  Do you know the licenses of all your application's dependencies? What open source software licenses will your business accept?

  LicenseFinder culls your Gemfile, detects the licenses of the gems in it, and gives you a report that you can act on. If you already know 
  what licenses your business is comfortable with, you can whitelist them, leaving you with an action report of only those dependencies that have 
  licenses that fall outside of the whitelist.
